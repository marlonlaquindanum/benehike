They are different in terms of the comfort, setup, storage and even the price. <br\/><br\/>When it comes to setup speed and ease, HardShell RTTs are renowned for their efficiency. Most can be established in mere minutes, with their hard cover also serving as a sturdy base. This quick setup contrasts with SoftShell RTTs, which demand a bit more time. The SoftShell setup typically involves unfurling a canvas and occasionally erecting some additional poles or components for the rainfly. The process, while not overly complex, is certainly more involved than that of its HardShell counterpart.<br\/><br\/>Another critical difference lies in the area of space and comfort. HardShell RTTs, given their design, tend to be more compact. While they offer a snug shelter, they might be a touch restrictive, especially for larger groups or families. SoftShell RTTs, on the other hand, prioritize spaciousness. Their design often caters to multiple sleepers, ensuring a more roomy and comfortable stay. This difference makes SoftShell RTTs particularly appealing to those who don't wish to compromise on space.<br\/><br\/>Lastly, while both tent types are designed for durability, there are some nuances in their protective features. HardShell RTTs, thanks to their solid structure, typically offer enhanced protection against harsh weather conditions, be it torrential rain or heavy snow. Their robust build promises longevity and resistance against the elements. SoftShell RTTs, predominantly crafted from canvas, can handle standard outdoor conditions with ease. However, over extended use, they might exhibit signs of wear and tear faster than their HardShell counterparts. The price points also differ, with HardShell tents often carrying a premium due to their build and features, while SoftShell tents tend to be more budget-friendly, making them a favorite among newcomers to rooftop camping.<br\/><br\/><\/p>",

            "text": "<p>There are three basic materials used in hard shell rooftop tents, and we list them all here to help you understand what type of hard-shell rooftop tent you should get. They are Aluminum; Fiberglass and ABS Plastic. <\/p><h3><strong>Aluminum Hard Shell Roof Top Tent<\/strong><\/h3><p>Aluminum is very common in hard shell roof top tent and i's the strongest material compared to the others. This means the aluminum hard shell rooftop tent is more endurable and can thereby withstand outside hits better than the other two. It also won't be damaged easily, pierced, or cracked. But it can be dented easily unless it's powder coated. <\/p><p>Another feature of an Aluminum hard shell rooftop tent is its weight. Since aluminum shells are less dense than fiberglass, it's lighter but it's still heavier compared to ABS plastic hard shell rooftop tent. When it comes to insulation, aluminum is not the good one and it's colder in winter and hotter in summer as it won't insulate compared to the other two materials. <\/p><p>So if you want something heavy and low profile, then aluminum hard shell rooftop tents are your first choice. And don't forget it can handle more weight than other materials. Check out Benehike's <a href=\"https:\/\/benehike.com\/collections\/aluminum-hardshell-rooftop-tents\" title=\"Aluminum hard shell rooftop tents\"><strong>Aluminum hard shell rooftop tents<\/strong><\/a> here. <\/p><h3><strong>Fiberglass Hard Shell Roof Top Tent<\/strong><\/h3><p>Fiberglass is another popular material used in hardshell roof top tents. Although it's fragile and might get broken by a big rock, branch, or hit from outside, it's still strong enough to withstand outside hazards. That's why you don't see crossbars over these fiberglass hardshell roof top tents. <\/p><p>However, today you won't see pure fiberglass hard shell roof top tents as they can be easily cracked. That's why Benehike uses fiberglass together with ABS plastic to ensure the insulated ability of rooftop tents while at the same time, making sure they're lightweight. <\/p><h3><strong>ABS Plastic Hard Shell Roof Top Tent<\/strong><\/h3><p>ABS it's also common in hardshell roof top tents. Compared to the other two materials, it has few benefits. For one thing it's the lightest material. This means if you want the lightest hard shell roof top tent, then find one made of ABS. Another good part is it's elastic. It won't crack or dent compared to other materials. That's why it is often used to shape different shapes and can be easily repaired. <\/p><p>However, it has downsides. One of them is that ABS plastic hard shell RTT can't endure extreme heat. This means it's not as insulating as the other two tents. <\/p><p>Another drawback is its poor performance when it's under UV ray. UV ray exposure can gradually cause some color to fade. Even so, this happens to most materials. And that's why Benehike developed Anti-UV 50+ Coating to prevent most of the UV rays. Even on big sunny days, exposure to the UV won't cause too much damage to our anti uv rooftop tents.<\/p>",

            "text": "<p>The styles of hard shell rooftop tents are actually looked at from their shapes and appearances. So there are mainly three types of hardshell RTT: Clamshell, Pop-up, and Side opening.<\/p><h3><strong>Clamshell Hard Shell roof top tents<\/strong><\/h3><p><br\/>You can tell from its name. Clamshell Hardshell rooftop tents are exactly like a clam. When it opens up, it's like the mouth of an alligator. But when it's put down, it's the same as other types. All you need to do is to lift the far side of the tent where the ladder is attached. Usually, you will lift it to a 37” upwards and then you crawl inside and enjoy your tent moments.<\/p><p>Clamshell usually has less room compared to the other two due to its outside shape, but it also means it's more cozy and enough for one or two person hard shell rooftop tents. It's also relatively cheaper compared to the other two. Check out Benehike's <a href=\"https:\/\/benehike.com\/collections\/clamshell-hardshell-roof-top-tents\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Clamshell Hard Shell roof top tents\"><strong>Clamshell Hard Shell roof top tents<\/strong><\/a><\/p><h3><strong>Pop-Up Hardshell Roof Top Tent <\/strong><\/h3><p>Pop-up hardshell tents are like a pop-up box when you open them, giving you enough room inside and having equal height on each side of the tent. When you set it up, all you need to do is life one side of it and then climb into the tent and lift the other side. But it's less than one minute for you to open it so it's quite convenient. <\/p><p>Pop-up RTTs are relatively more spacious since it's a full-size box, which means they usually fit more people and can accommodate more bedding. You can often see 4-5 person pop up hardshell rooftop tents, which are ideal for family outings or friends overlanding. Inside the Pop-up tents, there are metal arm opening feature, meaning it's more sturdy and rugged. <\/p><h3><strong>Side Opening Hardshell Rooftop Tent <\/strong><\/h3><p>Side-opening tent, it's more like a regular hardshell rooftop tent but can be more spacious. You can often see different sizes of side-opening hardshell RTTs, from for one or two people, to 4-5. How? Well, this is because they open from the side just like a clamshell, yet it can fit more people when you pull out the panel from the base. This means it can create more room by adding extra width and thereby accommodating more people. When you pull out the panel, the top of the tent can also stretch out to cover the extra panel side and it can be very flexible for you to choose. <\/p><p>You can also browse our <a href=\"https:\/\/benehike.com\/collections\/side-open-roof-top-tent-benehike\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Side Open Rooftop Tent\"><strong>side-opening hardshell rooftop tents<\/strong> <\/a>here.<\/p>",
